          <p>It all began about 20,000 years ago when an alien race started to take
            notice of the humans on Kurier. They were very intrigued about their
            behavior and wanted to find out more about them. In pursuit of their
            curiosity, they went to the planet and took around 1,000 humans and
            brought them to the planet of Arco.</p>
          <p>Once they arrived on the planet the alien race conducted many tests on the
            humans. The humans in their current state were not what interested the
            alien race, but their potential and future evolution are what peaked their
            interests. After they completed their research, the alien race returned
            home, leaving the humans alone to fend for themselves.
